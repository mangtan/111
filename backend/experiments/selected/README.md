This folder contains the recommended figures (one per type) for the paper:

- fig1_compression_recall.png — Recall vs. Compression Rate (Top‑K/Total %). Shows that the optimal solution is consistently recalled under high compression.
- fig2_runtime_comparison.png — End‑to‑end runtime: Full brute‑force vs Proposed filtering (speedup annotation).
- fig3_llm_parsing_accuracy.png — Rule extraction accuracy by field under tolerances (±0.5% voltage, ±5% loading).
- fig4_forecast_evaluation.png — Load prediction evaluation: scatter vs ideal line, and error histogram.
- fig5_ablation.png — Ablation: multi‑modal fusion vs single features (degradation when removing a feature).

Suggested captions are in the main response.
